# Time Series Analysis with Prophet

This repo aims to analyze the results using the time series analysis technique for Prophet from Meta (Facebook).
Even though I will show my approach to predicting the future values of a stock, I would like to explain others' approaches:

1) ARIMA is a traditional approach to check this type of analysis.
2) LLM will check its behavior to predict values and plot graphs.

## Prophet

A traditional approach to checking its results, a.k.a. ARIMA, attacks one type of series called temporal series, which is not stationary.

### 2.1) Introduction

This type of series does not show regularity, such as the behavior of a CPU. It is the typical manner of stock options, a measure of earth shake, etc.

I aim to use the Prophet model, based on Machine Learning, to predict the future values of stock options; in this case, I have chosen Nubank. Let's start.

### 2.2) Code
