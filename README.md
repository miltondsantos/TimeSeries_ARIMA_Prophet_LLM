# Time Series Analysis with ARIMA / Prophet / LLM

This repo aims to compare the results using three techniques for time series analysis:

1) A traditional approach and check its results, a.k.a. ARIMA.
2) Another using the Prophet has ML resources.
3) LLM will check its behavior to predict values and plot graphs.

## 1) ARIMA

## 2) Prophet

A traditional approach to checking its results, a.k.a. ARIMA, attacks one type of series called temporal series, which is not stationary.

### 2.1) Introduction

This type of series does not show regularity, such as the behavior of a CPU. It is the typical manner of stock options, a measure of earth shake, etc.

I aim to use the Prophet model, based on Machine Learning, to predict the future values of stock options; in this case, I have chosen Nubank. Let's start.
